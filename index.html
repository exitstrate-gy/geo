				<h2>60 years of satellite launches: the world’s spaceports, 1957-2017</h2>
				<p>The Soviet Union built the first spaceport, Baikonur Cosmodrome, in 1957. Since then, about 30 more launch sites were built around the world. A few of them have been closed.

				<h3>How to read this map</h3>
				<p>Grey markers indicate sites that have been decommissioned. Green markers show sites still in use.</p>
				<h3>Notable spaceports</h3>
				<img src="images/baikonur.jpg" width=400 align=left>
				<ul>
					<li>Oldest spaceport on this map: Baikonur Cosmodrome (Russia)</li>
					<li>Newest spaceports on this map: Vostochny Cosmodrome (Russia) and China Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site (China)</li>
					<li>Shortest tenure: Omelek Island in Pacific Ocean (2 years))</li>
					<li>Most interesting mobile platform: Sea Launch Ocean Odyssey platform is a private commercial launch platform. It docks in Long Beach, California and travels 11 days to the equator to launch its payloads. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Launch">Sea Launch</a> was founded by a multinational consortium and was acquired by Russia’s S7 Airlines in December 2016.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Why might Italy and France build spaceports in Africa?</h3>
				<p>Getting a spaceport closer to the equator makes launch planning more flexible. France and Italy may have concluded that the necessary real estate for a spaceport would be easier to get in Africa. However, placing spaceports here may have had the disadvantage of being hard to reach from where the materials were likely manufactured. Ultimately, neither spaceport lasted past the 1980s.</p>

				<p>To build a useful satellite launch site, you’d need the ability to transport large items (like a railway to bring in a rocket from its place of manufacture). You’d lots of room for debris like spent rockets to fall — and this area should be to the east, so you can take advantage of the earth’s west-to-east rotation. For bonus points, build your launch site closer to the equator; this will maximize your options for your satellite’s orbital inclination.</p>
				<h3>Why are satellites important?</h3>
				<p>Satellites are the most common products created by the commercial space industry. Commercial space organizations don’t yet enjoy budgets on the scale of NASA, ESA, or Roscosmos. Unlike interplanetary probes and astronaut transport systems, satellites are small enough and functionally limited enough for the commercial space sector to explore and develop.</p>
				<p>Cubesats currently represent the newest and most economical form for a satellite. They’re often used for imaging the earth and logistical monitoring. Farmers use infrared satellite images to assess field health and calculate crop yield. Satellite services help logistics companies  track ship and plane positions at a useful frequency.</p>
				<p>Some examples of companies currently using cubesats for global business intelligence:</p> 
				<ul>
					<li>Planet</li>
					<li>Spire Global</li>
					<li>Planetary Resources</li>
					<li>Astro Digital</li>
					<li>Ceres Imaging</li>
					<li>Orbital Insight</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Several companies will also be launching numerous satellites in the coming years to offer high-speed internet. For example, SpaceX recently filed with the FCC to operate a constellation of 4,425 satellites. OneWeb and Boeing are expected to launch similar constellations.</p>
