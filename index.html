				<h2>60 years of satellites: the world’s spaceports, 1957-2017</h2>
				<p>The Soviet Union built the first spaceport, Baikonur Cosmodrome, in 1957. In October of that year, Sputnik 1 launched and stayed in orbit for a few months. Since then, about 30 more launch sites were built around the world, and over 1,000 satellites are currently orbiting Earth.</p>	
				<p>The map below shows all satellite launch sites ever built.</p>

			<h3>Notable spaceports</h3>
			<img src="images/baikonur.jpg" alt="Baikonur Cosmodrome" title="Soyuz on the launch pad at Baikonur" width=400 align=left class="baikonur">

			<p>The oldest spaceport ever built is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baikonur_Cosmodrome">Baikonur Cosmodrome</a> in Russia (see image), where Sputnik 1 launched. Baikonur is currently the only site for manned missions to ISS.</p>
			<p>The world’s newest spaceports are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vostochny_Cosmodrome">Vostochny Cosmodrome</a> in Russia and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Wenchang_Spacecraft_Launch_Site">China Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site</a> near Hong Kong, both built in 2016.</p>
			<p>The spaceport with the shortest tenure is either the US base at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omelek_Island">Omelek Island</a> in Pacific Ocean or France’s Hammaguir French Special Weapons Test Centre in Algeria. Both lasted about 2 years.</p>
			<p>IMO the most interesting mobile platform is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey_(launch_platform)">Sea Launch Ocean Odyssey</a> platform is a private commercial launch platform. It docks in Long Beach, California and travels 11 days to the equator to launch its payloads. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Launch">Sea Launch</a> was founded by a multinational consortium and was acquired by Russia’s S7 Airlines in December 2016.</p>
			<h3>Why might Italy and France build spaceports in Africa?</h3>
			<p>Building a spaceport a bit closer to the equator makes launches more flexible. Nascent French and Italian space agencies may also have initially expected that the necessary real estate for a spaceport would be easier to get in Africa. However, they might have suffered difficulties in transporting materials. Ultimately, France withdrew from its Algerian base in 1967 as part of the Evián Accords, and Italy allowed its Kenyan launch site to fall into disrepair in the 1990s.</p>
			<h3>Features of an Ideal Spaceport Location</h3>
			<a href="https://exitstrate-gy.github.io/satports/images/Geographic_Features_of_an_Ideal_Spaceport.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="images/Geographic_Features_of_an_Ideal_Spaceport.jpeg" title="Top 3 Features of an Ideal Spaceport Location" alt="diagram of spaceport location features" width=400 align=left></a>
			<p>If you were choosing a useful satellite launch site, you’d consider the need for transporting large items (like a railway to bring in a rocket from its place of manufacture). You’d want lots of room for debris like spent rockets to fall — and this area should be to the east, so your launch can take advantage of the earth’s west-to-east rotation. For bonus points, build your launch site closer to the equator; this will maximize your options for your satellite’s orbital inclination.</p>
			<p>The spaceport most closely resembling this diagram is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alc%C3%A2ntara_Launch_Center">Alcântara Launch Center</a> in Brazil, which satisfies the top requirements of a successful spaceport. Incidentally, Alcântara doesn’t show on the map above because they <a href="http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/trend-lines/20279/brazil-works-to-make-its-space-program-self-sufficient">haven’t yet launched a satellite</a>.
				<h3>Why are satellites important?</h3>
				<p>Satellites are the commercial space industry’s most common launch payload. Unlike interplanetary probes and astronaut transport systems, satellites are small enough, functionally limited enough, and profitable enough for the commercial space sector to explore and develop.</p>
				<img src="images/planet-labs-flock.jpg"  class="cubesats" title="Cubesats at Planet" alt="a shelf of cubesats" width=400 align=left>
				<p>Cubesats currently represent the newest and most economical form of satellite. They’re often used for imaging the earth and logistical monitoring. Farmers use infrared satellite images to assess field health and calculate crop yield. Satellite services help logistics companies  track ship and plane positions at a useful frequency.</p>
				<p>Some examples of companies currently using cubesats for global business intelligence:</p> 
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://planet.com">Planet</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://spire.com">Spire Global</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://planetaryresources.com">Planetary Resources</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://astrodigital.com/">Astro Digital</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://www.ceresimaging.net/">Ceres Imaging</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://orbitalinsight.com/">Orbital Insight</a></li>
				</ul>

				<p>Several companies will also be launching numerous satellites in the coming years to offer high-speed internet. For example, SpaceX recently filed with the FCC to operate a constellation of 4,425 new satellites (yet to be launched). OneWeb and Boeing are expected to launch similar constellations.</p>
